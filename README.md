## Project Overview

JVC Wallet consists of a backend server and a frontend application (my-wallet). The backend is built with Node.js and Express, and it interacts with the Moralis API to fetch token balances, NFTs, and native cryptocurrency balances for a given user address. The frontend (my-wallet) which is built with react and vite, provides a user interface to interact with this backend.

### Backend

The backend server exposes an API endpoint to retrieve data related to tokens, NFTs, and balance for a given user address.

### Frontend

The frontend application provides a user interface for account creation, recovery, and viewing wallet details.
